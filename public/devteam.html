                <pre>
                  
Notes for Customer meeting May 7, 2014:

ToDo:
·      Password too short (Doesn’t tell you password restrictions)
·      Next to Logout button show who is logged in
·      Maybe make about/contact/help text easier to see
·      Need a bigger TeamPlayer logo. Something that pops out
·      Logout button too close to groups? Alignment? Might accidently click logout

 

Notes:
·      Went to About/Contact/User Manual first. Easy to use. Figured out how to get back easily
·      Login is easy. Worried about safety of information
·      Password too short (Doesn’t tell you password restrictions)
·      Impressed with our zero feature :D (“Wow”)
·      Bills expected ordering: due date probably
·      Buttons on home screen don’t work
·      Thoughts: Pretty intuitive, easy to use and figure out
·      User manual looks good
·      Next to Logout button show who is logged in
·      Logout button too close to groups? Alignment? Might accidently click logout
·      Login page could be laid out nicer maybe? Too much spacing below description
·      Maybe make about/contact/help text easier to see
·      Need a bigger TeamPlayer logo. Something that pops out
                </pre>
              
                <h4>Customer Meeting: May 12, 2014</h4>
<pre>
.      improve the visibility of the tabs on the bills page
.      (optional) on create group description
.      developers button on top to link to development information
</pre>
              	<h2 id="sec4">Paper Prototype Notes</h2>
<pre>
Customer Role:
<ul>
<li>Home screen: text amount is good because normally people are bounced away from too much text. </li>
<li>Filter Tab: hovering versus tapping. User finds hovering to be cumbersome with the side bar (too easy to activate and too difficult to exit)</li>
<li>Calendar: initial confusion over rotating tasks because of the multiple member displays. </li>
<li>Create Task: Confusion on the specifics of clicking away from a box what shows up. What happens if you hit tab. What happens if you tap on the next box. 
    Same vocabulary problem- as long as it’s consistent. 
    Confusion over dateless tasks vs todos at first. </li>
<li>Searching: User searching for users not in group could be a problem. Autocomplete or a search function. </li>
<li>Create Bill:
    Amounts that don’t add up lead to an error screen. Application will need to validate that you haven’t filled everything out. 
    Dateless bills. </li>
<li>Pop-Up Dates: Good. Scroll bar commented on.</li>
<li>Team Page: Weary of the plus and minus buttons because of confusion over functionality.
Additionally, plus and minus buttons need internal consistency.  
    Can’t delete a group can only leave a group. 
    Someone makes the group, invites other people, disappears when everyone leaves.
    Delete whole group: possibly a manager.
    No emails at all suggested.</li></ul>
<ul>Advisor Role:
    <li>Feasible or not is confusing because of the amount of factors involved.</li>
    <li>Need to prioritize all the features involved.</li> 
    <li>Work on them in sequence by figuring out dependencies on feature and planning from there and priority. </li></ul>
