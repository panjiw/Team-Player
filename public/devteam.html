                  <pre>
                    
                  Notes for Customer meeting May 7, 2014:

                  ToDo:
                  ·      Password too short (Doesn’t tell you password restrictions)
                  ·      Next to Logout button show who is logged in
                  ·      Maybe make about/contact/help text easier to see
                  ·      Need a bigger TeamPlayer logo. Something that pops out
                  ·      Logout button too close to groups? Alignment? Might accidently click logout

                   

                  Notes:
                  ·      Went to About/Contact/User Manual first. Easy to use. Figured out how to get back easily
                  ·      Login is easy. Worried about safety of information
                  ·      Password too short (Doesn’t tell you password restrictions)
                  ·      Impressed with our zero feature :D (“Wow”)
                  ·      Bills expected ordering: due date probably
                  ·      Buttons on home screen don’t work
                  ·      Thoughts: Pretty intuitive, easy to use and figure out
                  ·      User manual looks good
                  ·      Next to Logout button show who is logged in
                  ·      Logout button too close to groups? Alignment? Might accidently click logout
                  ·      Login page could be laid out nicer maybe? Too much spacing below description
                  ·      Maybe make about/contact/help text easier to see
                  ·      Need a bigger TeamPlayer logo. Something that pops out

                  <pre>
                  .    Creating a bill not clear who's going to pay the bill. 
                  .    Add some way to understand who’s responsible.  
                  .    Doesn’t show that you owe fifty dollars when it’s owed to yourself. 
                  .    How do you rmember what you have 
                       to pay when it shows up.
                  .    Fifty out of one hundred needs to show up; need to see the total of the bill. Select all and 
                       clear all would be nice. 
                  .    The calendar is nicely done.
                  .    Refreshing the page goes back to the homepage- not good. 
                  .    Tabs seem like a completely different page 
                       and should be treated like that.
                  .    Change a password needs to type the new password twice (password confirmation).
                  .    Putting bills page together would be fine. 
                  .    Cycle tasks should go away from your tasks; should appear on the next person’s.
                  .    Key for what the colors mean.
                  .    Completed tasks good on calendar
                  .    Any task created or involved in should be displayed, but not involved in should be greyed out.

                  <pre>Customer Role:
                  <ul>
                  <li>Home screen: text amount is good because normally people are bounced away from too much text. </li>
                  <li>Filter Tab: hovering versus tapping. User finds hovering to be cumbersome with the side bar (too easy to activate and too difficult to exit)</li>
                  <li>Calendar: initial confusion over rotating tasks because of the multiple member displays. </li>
                  <li>Create Task: Confusion on the specifics of clicking away from a box what shows up. What happens if you hit tab. What happens if you tap on the next box. 
                      Same vocabulary problem- as long as it’s consistent. 
                      Confusion over dateless tasks vs todos at first. </li>
                  <li>Searching: User searching for users not in group could be a problem. Autocomplete or a search function. </li>
                  <li>Create Bill:
                      Amounts that don’t add up lead to an error screen. Application will need to validate that you haven’t filled everything out. 
                      Dateless bills. </li>
                  <li>Pop-Up Dates: Good. Scroll bar commented on.</li>
                  <li>Team Page: Weary of the plus and minus buttons because of confusion over functionality.
                  Additionally, plus and minus buttons need internal consistency.  
                      Can’t delete a group can only leave a group. 
                      Someone makes the group, invites other people, disappears when everyone leaves.
                      Delete whole group: possibly a manager.
                      No emails at all suggested.</li></ul>
                  <ul>Advisor Role:
                      <li>Feasible or not is confusing because of the amount of factors involved.</li>
                      <li>Need to prioritize all the features involved.</li> 
                      <li>Work on them in sequence by figuring out dependencies on feature and planning from there and priority. </li></ul>
