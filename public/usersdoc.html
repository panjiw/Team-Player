                <h2 id="whyTeamPlayer">Thinking Behind TeamPlayer</h2>
                <p>TeamPlayer is centralized around a calendar - a group calendar to be exact! It was created with the idea that managing roommates could be easier. Instead of one person being most responsible, assigning chores, making sure items are stocked, paying bills, TeamPlayer can keep everyone accountable, even if it is just knowing that tasks are being done. The calendar displays all group activity. You know what everyone else has to do, but most importantly, you know what you have to do and when everyone expects you to have finished it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>TeamPlayer can be divided into three parts: tasks, bills, and groups.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i>Tasks</i> are any types of duties: chores, grocery lists, bills to pay. They can contain only one person in the group, or multiple people. They can also be dated and dateless (like a to-do list) to know when they need to be done by.</li>
                  <li><i>Bills</i> are payments that have been done, and can include multiple people, so you can manage how much people owe you.</li>
                  <li><i>Groups</i> are multiple people who share some commonality.</li>
                </ul>
