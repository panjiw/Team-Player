              	<h2 id="whatis">What is TeamPlayer?</h2>
                TeamPlayer is a group-centered web application that allows you to organize the mess of sharing duties and bills between groups of people in your life, such as friends, roommates, sports teams, and coworkers.<br><br>
                With our calendar-centered interface, each member can stay up to date with their individual and group tasks as well as the amount of money they owe one another. This decreases the need for all members to remember what everyone was responsible for and also decreases the need to remind other group mates to pay you back, saving time from communication and stress from memory.

                      Our target audience expands past roommates as a user base, as our product can be used in project groups who need to organize individual tasks, in planning groups that need to plan events and tasks prepared at specific times, as well as friend groups who need to organize trips.

                      TeamPlayer solves communication problems between groups of people, especially problems created by poor scheduling, poor due date reminders, and miscommunications over finances. It will help groups:
                      <ul>
                        <li>reduce the time needed to communicate with multiple people</li>

                      </ul>Overall, it will help cleanly facilitate group bills and tasks by providing a clean interface to view and assign tasks.

              	<p>
                We decided to make our project a web-based application, because web is cross-platform. We also acknowledged that building well-designed UIs, which will be a large factor over our competitors, is easiest with web languages. Based on our skill set, here are the tools we chose to use to create TeamPlayer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</b>: 
                    <ul>These are the backbone of the frontend of any web application, and will be used heavily to create our application.</ul></li>
                  <li><b>JQuery</b>:
                    <ul>This is a JavaScript library that will simplify our frontend code by providing helpful functions on Ajax requests, basic animation, selecting elements in the DOM, etc.</ul></li>
                  <li><b>Bootstrap</b>:
                    <ul>A JavaScript and CSS library originally from Twitter, we will be using some of their default styles and boilerplate code to help aid our design of the website. For example, it is not terribly easy to implement a professional looking button or form in HTML/CSS, but Bootstrap’s provided CSS will help us make the site more professional.</ul></li>
                  <li><b>AngularJS</b>:
                    <ul>This is a MV* framework for frontend heavy applications. We will use it as both a “frontend PHP” (e.g. HTML with control flow), and to easily inject the data from the backend.</ul></li>
                  <li><b>Ruby/Rails</b>: 
                    <ul>We will use Ruby on Rails as our backend framework. The backend will provide the overall architecture of the site, as well as handle querying the database, and returning the formatted data to the front end.</ul></li>
                  <li><b>sqlite3/PostgreSQL</b>:
                    <ul>Our data will be very relational, so our ruby on rails backend will this database to store data, sqlite3 for development and PostgreSQL for production. Then we will query it through the ruby functions. The data will solely come from user input, as the application is driven around group task management.</ul></li>
                  <li><b>Git/Github</b>: 
                    <ul>This will function both as our version control and bug tracking system. As noted in lecture, Git is a fairly intuitive and popular version control system. Github's bug tracking system is visual and clear.</ul></li>
                  <li><b>Heroku</b>: 
                    <ul>We will be using Heroku to deploy our app. It has Ruby on Rails already installed, so will simplify the deployment process. </ul></li>
                  <li><b>Jenkins</b>: 
                    <ul>This is a continuous integration system used to deploy automated daily testing on our product. It also sends emails when builds have failed. </ul></li>
                </ul>

          		  The main UI challenge will likely be implementing the calendar view. We first discussed Google Calendar, which would send our information and display it on their google calendar, but unfortunately that would allow users to modify their calendar without going through our system. That would immediately render our backend inconsistent with their view, which is a problem we do not want to have.<br><br>
                We then came across an AngularJS calendar implementation, FullCalendar, that allowed more control over user access. We use this as the base for our calendar, and add features such as popping up modals to display events on a day. In addition to that, our frameworks (Angular and Rails) and libraries (JQuery), will help prevent us from needing to reinvent the wheel. After getting past the learning curve, these should dramatically reduce the amount of code we need to write. This will be especially important in synchronizing the backend and frontend.From scratch, we will likely need to design/code the frontend views (login, manage groups, calendar, TODOs, and bills). On the backend, we will need to design the database architecture, and how to query it.

                Alternatives to these problems already exist, like: <br>
                HomeSlice, which manages a social network between roommates to help with communication. HomeSlice seeks to provide incentive for good behavior and transparency in group dynamics. They provide a whiteboard to help with communication between roommates, a supplies manager to help with who needs to buy what and how much is left, and a chores and bills manager to help facilitate tasks and finances. Their app provides a clean interface for a small community, being roommates, to manage basic tasks.  Its advantages are that it provides push notifications to notify community members of tasks they need to do.However, users have complained that the application does not provide the ability to submit one bill for multiple members. Additionally, there’s no way to snooze events. 
                <br><br>Google Calendar provides an event based approach in a calendar format. Its advantages include already being widely used, and an integration with other Google software like Gmail. You can create a shared calendar, as well as subscribe to multiple calendars (e.g. a personal one). However, it is weak for groups because it is only task based--there is no concept of “bill management”. It also does not allow for tasks that do not have a specific due date.

              
              	<hr>
                <h2 id="solution">Our Solution</h2>

                Our application will differentiate itself by providing a calendar view of events to facilitate time-dependant tasks. While HomeSlice provides a lot of services for roommates to organize their group, it does not provide a calendar view that could make the application difficult for paying bills on time or completing tasks on time. Furthermore, HomeSlice specifically targets roommates as a user base and not just groups who need to organize events. Seeing as our application works with general tasks and bills and not specifics like supplies, we can reach a wider audience. 
                <br><br>
                <h4><b>Major features:</b></h4> 
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Group Management</b>
                    <ul>Create a TeamPlayer group for every group in your life, and all tasks/bills will be centered around these groups. You will no longer have to personally keep everyone up to date with the group's responsibilities. Every member in the group can see what’s going on.</ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Cycling and Repeating Task Creation</b>
                      <ul>For the tasks that you seem to always be the only one doing, like cleaning the bathroom or picking up dinner, you can include your groups in your tasks. In addition to setting deadlines and making them repeat, you have the choice to cycle your tasks. This means that when one person has finished it, the task will automatically be given to the next person.</ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Bill Memory and Bill Splitting</b>
                      <ul>For the outstanding bills people still owe you, and the need to keep track of things that were paid. TeamPlayer  compiles expenses paid by and needed to be paid by users. You can see a summary of what people owe you, and what you owe to others.</ul>
                  </li>
                    <li><b>Organization</b>
                    <ul>A main calendar allows you to see all upcoming, current, and past tasks and bills in one place to keep track of your deadlines. </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="schedules">Development Schedule</h2>
                <p>Our team roles were selected based on interests and experience. <i>Karthik</i> became our project manager because he was interested in understanding the integration of front and back end, and had some experience in other frameworks and API's. <i>Fung, Linsen, and Tiffany</i> were front end developers because they had a bit of knowledge in web development or were interested in visual aesthetics and design. <i>Keith, Micaela, and Panji</i> were back end developers because they had previously taken database classes are were familiar with more development languages. Despite these roles however, members were expected to help one another whenever things needed to get done.</p>

                <p>This is a calendar of our development schedule, based on course deadlines and our core featres: group management, login, bill/task creation, calendar display, to do list display, and bill display. The following colors correspond to the topics:</p>

                <img src="images/timeline.png"/>

                <p><ul>
                  <li><b>blue: CSE 403 course deadlines</b></li>
                  <li><b>green: front end feature deadlines</b></li>
                  <li><b>red: back end model creation deadlines</b></li>
                  <li><b>orange: integration and testing deadlines</b></li>
                  <li><b>purple: TeamPlayer tutorial deadlines</b></li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>We estimated the amount of time needed to implement our major features based on the following reasons:<p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Task & Bill Display/Login = 1 week</b></li>
                      <ul>This merely stores user ID, email, and group names in a database. The system needs to handle group invitations, which can be as simple as sending out emails. This should take 2-3 days but the setup of a working database may require 3-4 days more.</ul>
                    <li><b>Group Management = 4 days</b></li>
                      <ul>This ensures accurate viewing of what groups a user is a part of. There is a lot of back end authentication, as well as display and updating after events.</ul>
                    <li><b>Bill/Task Creation = 1 week</b></li>
                      <ul>Creating bills and task are very similar, we need to create a simple UI for inserting data values into the database. Simple forms and validations are easy to implement.</ul>
                    <li><b>Calendar/To Do List Display = 1-2 weeks</b></li>
                      <ul>Displaying calendar takes longer because of the complex ways we can put them on the web app with possible features like monthly, weekly, day views and color coding events and tasks. More importantly, we need to figure out how the data will be stored on database to allow scalability.</ul>
                  </ul>

                <h2 id="postmortem">Requirements and Schedule Postmortem</h2>
                  <p>Even though we created a rigid schedule for the creation of TeamPlayer, we did have many changes to our product, and surprising estimations to how long feature implementation would take. Here is <a href="documentation/OriginalDocuments/workTimeline.htm">how our developers actually spent their time</a>.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Based on the schedule above, these are the estimates for the amount of time it took to implement the following features:<br>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Successful Login and Logout (5 days)</b></li>
                        <ul>It took about 4 days for one developer to create user models and login/session systems, as well as handling AJAX requests. At the same time, another developer created login and home pages.</ul>
                      <li><b>Group Creation, Member Addition and Confirmation (9 days)</b></li>
                        <ul>It took a developer 3 days to create group models and controllers, while a second developer took about a 1 day to create a group display, and a third developer took about 3 days to integrate the front end and back end. Later on, we added the group confirmation feature which took another 3 days to do.</ul>
                      <li><b>Adding, Editing and Completing Tasks (5 days)</b></li>
                        <ul>It took a developer about 2 days to design and implement the task system and controllers. Another developer took about a day to create the tasks views, and a third one to integrate the front end and back end. </ul>
                      <li><b>Adding and Paying Bills (6 days)</b></li>
                        <ul>It took a developer about 2 days to design and implement the bills system and controllers. </ul>
                      <li><b>Calendar and To Do List Display (3 days)</b><li>
                        <ul>It took a developer about a day to get the calendar to display on the homepage, then about two days to get calendar interactions as well as the correct task and bill displays working.</ul>
                      <li><b>User Friendly Tutorials (2 days)</b></li>
                        <ul>It took about a day to create tutorials for views, and another to maintain and keep them consistent. </ul>
                    </ul>

                  </p>

                  <h3>Feature Cuts</h3>
                  <p>
                    We completed the major features and functionality listed in the SRS. We can view, create, and edit tasks, bills, and groups. We also have a home view with a calendar that shows when tasks and bills are due. Here are the smaller features we cut or added:<br><br>

                    <b>Functionality cut from original SRS</b>:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The concept of filtering views by groups is entirely gone because we did not find it to be useful or necessary after talking to customers and during usability testing <i>(saved: probably only a couple of hours)</i></li>
                      <li>Bills can no longer cycle or repeat because it seemed less useful than that cycling/repeating tasks--again feedback from customers <i>(saved: 10+ hours)</i></li>
                      <li>Email invites if a member you are inviting is not a registered user <i>(saved: 4-5 hours)</i></li>
                    </ul>
                  
                    <b>Added features (now in updated SRS)</b>:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Group confirmation--when you invite somebody to a group, they are not in the group until they accept the invite.</li>
                      <li>We changed the bills tab to show a bill summary by member (i.e. what do they owe you, what do you owe them, and what is the net total), rather than showing every bill separately. We also removed filtering bills by group.</li>
                      <li>The ability to edit groups, tasks, and bills. This is something we talked about, but was not officially in the SRS. This is also an alternative to snoozing/moving tasks.</li>
                      <li>Using different colors for tasks, bills, and overdue events, as well as lighter colors for ones that are not yours on the calendar as an alternative to filtering by group. </li>
                      <li>The concept of a “self group”--when you login to the app for the first time, it makes sense to already be part of a group just for you.</li>
                      <li>A history of bills and tasks on the respective tabs (the original only had a history on the calendar).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                  <h3>Task Assignments</h3>
                  <p>As explained in our SRS, our original roles were: 
                    <ul>
                      <li>Project Manager: Karthik</li>
                      <li>Front End Developers: Linsen, Fung, Tiffany</li>
                      <li>Back End Developers: Micaela, Panji, Keith</li>
                    </ul>

                    Over the course of development, the roles stayed relatively the same with a little bit of adjustment. Panji and Keith were able to pick up Ruby on Rails really quickly, and quickly jumped on database design as well as backend designs of groups, tasks, and bills. Micaela also learned Ruby on Rails and ended up as the tester of these objects. Since there were three front end people, and front end design wasn’t always needed, Fung picked up Angular JS and joined Karthik in integration of the front end and back end. Linsen had already known HTML and CSS and assisted Tiffany on the front end. Karthik’s role changed whenever things needed attention, switching between back end design, front end debugging, and integration. 
                  </p>

                  <p>Below, our developers explain what they spent the most time on:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Karthik Palaniappan(Project Manager)</li>
                        <ul>In the beginning of the project, obviously most of our time was spent in flushing out the details of our app--first the features and UIs (i.e. SRS) and then the actual design and architecture with respect to our frameworks (SDS). I was involved in both the backend and frontend at this point. However, once we started coding, I focused almost exclusively on the frontend code. I definitely spent a lot of time learning Angular--it is a decent framework once you get the hang of it, but it still is confusing and has awful documentation. From there, the majority of my time was spent on the frontend logic for groups (adding, editing, leaving, inviting, etc), and helping Fung with tasks and bills (and finding/fixing bugs). Other than that, I usually helped Tiffany out with the documents due each Friday.</ul>
                      <li>Linsen Wu (Front End Developer)</li>
                        <ul>In the beginning I spent a lot of time figuring out bootstrap and then using that to build the layout of the website. Then, when we had our layout finished I spent a lot of my time figuring out how angular worked, and then using that to take data that the backend group had supplied and display it on our pages. Most of my time was spent on the Bills page and home page. I worked on getting the right bills to show up, mapping bills to members, getting bills to pay, and adding bills. I also worked on getting the todos and calendar display working on the home page. At the end of the project I spent more time learning how the backend worked and how data was being stored so I could get the right data and store data how I needed it in order to display correctly.</ul>
                      <li>Tsz Fung Cheung (Front End Developer)</li>
                        <ul> In the beginning I spent lots of time experimenting  with Javascript and AngularJS. The first few weeks I spent most of my time on trying to connect Javascript with the back end, while working on login, log out, and group creation. During that time debugging was really time consuming as I did not understand how does date binding work with AngularJS; we used some “temporary hack” to make things work but we end up spending time clean them up later. Near the end of the quarter I spent most of my time on tasks and bills functionality including creation, edition, paying bills, and completing tasks. The time consuming part was to coordinate with Panji and make sure tasks and bills works on both front and back end. We had to test the code together. After those were done, I spent most of my time fixing bugs.</ul>
                      <li>Tiffany Lin</li>
                        <ul> Throughout the project, most of my time has been spent documenting - creating some documents, making sure that our documents were up to date, transferring them from google docs to our developer’s website. At the beginning, I spent some time creating user interfaces using Powerpoint to make sure that we could all visualize how our project would work through pictures instead of words. This was helpful because by seeing a consistent view, we could visualize what would and wouldn’t work well. Later on, I spent a lot of time learning HTML and CSS to make sure that our displays were correct. Since this was my first time using HTML, CSS, and javascript, it took me a lot of time to implement features and fix bugs. Toward the end of the project, I was able to use these skills to get the home page calendar to be interactive with our users, even though it took about a week. </ul>
                      <li>Micaela Tolliver</li>
                        <ul>The majority of my time was spent testing, either from learning the testing framework for ruby on rails and reworking some initial tests that didn’t use the framework correctly. From then on, testing the backend controllers took up the majority of my time. While writing test cases, the majority of my time was spent formatting checks for return statements, since our implementation returned strings and I needed to parse to make sure the correct information was returned. </ul>
                      <li>Panji Wisesa</li>
                        <ul>At first, getting familiarized with  Ruby on Rails and applying that small bits of knowledge straight into the project took up most of my time. After that learning period, most of my time was occupied with implementing the task and bill models and controllers, then coordinating with Fung to make sure that the code I wrote in the back connects correctly with the code in the front end.</ul>
                      <li>Keith Yeung</li>
                        <ul>Most of my workload was building initial backend models to support a feature, then readjusting some fields and controllers, based on frontend and usability designs decisions. The initial coding didn’t take too long, so majority of my time is in meetings to discuss designs decisions and thinking about how it can be implemented. Fixing bugs, adding ‘if’ checks on methods after test or misuses were raised took some time also.</ul>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    <h4>Expectation Differences</h4>
                    This differs from our expectations because we did not realize how hard it would be to learn Angular and Rails. Both are fairly big and heavy frameworks that have a non-trivial learning curve. We expected to spend most of our time coding, but we did not expect debugging and fixing bugs on the frontend would take so long. We had a full MVC on the frontend, but unfortunately, we did not plan out “who would be working what” very well, so we occasionally ended up touching code we did not understand. Touching other people’s code often led to more bugs.<br><br>

                    <h4>Features Spent Too Much Time On</h4>
                    We ended up spending too much time on team meetings and discussions, which is a pro and a con. We initially agreed that being able to set aside time to be able to discuss problems face to face and as a group would be a good idea, because decisions would be made more quickly, and everybody would be able to contribute. This was actually really helpful when it came to designing both the frontend and backend, as well as changing things based on usability tests with our customers. However, there were times when it would have been okay if some members did not show up to meeting and instead kept working on their own tasks. We also spent a lot of time debugging and fixing the bills view on the frontend. We wanted to have different views based on the same data, so the backend just sent a list of bills. From there, we had a lot of work on the frontend parsing it into different forms, and integrating those forms with Angular. At the same time, we also had multiple people working on bills, so this is the main place where we ran into “touching somebody else’s code” and breaking it. <br><br>

                    <h4>Features Spent Too Little Time On</h4>
                    We spent too little time on frontend-testing and automating installing/deployment. The backend test suite was *solid*, but frontend testing is a little more difficult, especially with both Rails and AngularJS. We ended up prioritizing the important frontend logic functions--like ordering users in alphabetical order for the view. However, there is no good way to test Ajax requests (i.e. most of the other functions) from Angular models. Anuglar does have its own integration testing framework, but it is nearly impossible to use with Rails because of the order that certain things are loaded. We initially had our developer docs inside of Google docs, meaning to create a new version, you would have to download the docs then upload them. We also did not have a way to automatically download all of the packages for our Rails app (there are a lot), or to deploy to Heroku. Life was much simpler both for us and other developers after creating automatic install and deployment scripts, as well as moving our document to HTML.
