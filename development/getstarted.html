                <br>
                Prior releases can be found on the same page. The latest version of our repository that we’re using for development can be found from here <a href="https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player.git">https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player.git</a>.

              	<h2 id="sec1">Getting started</h2>
              	<p>
                If you are unfamilar with Ruby on Rails, here is a <a href="#sec5">quick guide to the file structure</a>
                The following installation instruction assume you are using a Linux system.
              	</p>
                <p>
                <ol><li>First setup rails environment for your OS<br>
                <code><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/">https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/</a></code></li>
                <br>
                <li>Install git, then navigate to folder you want to store our codes and run<br>
                <code>git clone https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player.git</code></li>
                <br>
                <li>Navigate inside Team-Player folder and run<br>
                <code>bundle install -- without production</code></li>
                <br>
                <li>Note: For security reasons, secrets.yml and database.yml are not shown publicly on github<br>
                To create your own navigate inside config folder<br>  -- rename the secrets-example.yml to secrets.yml
                    <br> -- rename database-example.yml to database.yml
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>To generate your secret_token, run <br>
                <code>rake secret</code><br>copy the key, and open secret.yml, replace the "run_rake_seret_and_copy_key_here" message
                <br> with your copied key, you have to paste it in two places</li>
                <br>

                <li>To setup the database run<br>
                <code>bundle exec rake db:migrate</code>
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>Finally, you can start the rails server, run<br>
                <code>rails s</code></li>
                <br>

                <li>If successful, you can see our application on<br>
                <code><a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a></code></li>
                <br>

                </ol>
                <p>Now you can start editing the codes and view the effects on localhost website!</p>

              	<p>
The tests provided for the software are in the spec folder. At the moement, these tests cover our backend implementation, and utilize RSpec. 
After you have downloaded our application, to run the test suite provided, go to the root directory of the project, run the command <br> 
<code>bundle exec rspec spec/</code><br>
This will run all the tests and output the results, more information about RSpec follow this link <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/frames">http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/frames</a>

              	<h2 id="sec4">Release new verion</h2>
      			
                Releases will be facilitated by GitHub’s release system. In-depth information on releasing software can be viewed on <br><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases">https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases</a>.<br> When releasing a new version of software, updates and fixes will be documented with the release. Additionally, branch information and version numbers will also be documented with the release. <br>
                Releases for our software can be found and downloaded from <br><a href="https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player/releases">https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player/releases</a>.<br>  New releases will be deployed through Heroku web services. For the first deployment, the developer should call “heroku create”. Then, when a new release is completed and ready to be copied to the website and viewed and run through our test suite, a developer will deploy their repository with “git push heroku master”. More information on how Heroku deploys releases can be found on <br><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/releases</a>.

            <h2 id="sec5">File Structure</h2>
    <p>The directory structure is created for Ruby on Rails applications, so we have the standard Ruby on Rails structure. From the root directory, listed below is information for the folders relevant to developers. Other folders contain information necessary for the product, I.E. bundle and rails files, but not necessary to edit for development. For further information on what those files contain, <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm</a> </p>
<ul>
  <li>root folder: contains gems and rake files for Ruby</li>
  <li><ul>
    <li>app: contains the application code, our backend ruby code and front end views. The subfolders include: assets, controllers, helpers, mailers, and models; contain code relevant to each of those subsections, I.E. the models for our user data will be stored in the model subfolder. The view folder contains the main front-end web files. </li>
    <li>config: contains the environment and key configuration for the product. </li>
    <li>db: contains the main backend data files in the database. </li>
    <li>devfiles: Contains front end development code. Includes Calendar front end  code, style sheets, and html view pages.</li>
    <li>public: contains public HTML documents (I.E. 404 page)</li>
    <li>spec: contains the testing information for backend and frontend development. Relevant tests for each section will be in its own subfolder, I.E. controller RSpec tests being in the controller subfolder and front-end javascript test being in the javascripts subfolder.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Documentation for the code can be found from the README in the main directory.</li>
</ul>

            <h2 id="sec6">Publishing To Heroku</h2>

Our application will differentiate itself by providing a calendar view of events to facilitate time-dependant tasks. While HomeSlice provides a lot of services for roommates to organize their group, it does not provide a calendar view that could make the application difficult for paying bills on time or completing tasks on time. Furthermore, HomeSlice specifically targets roommates as a user base and not just groups who need to organize events. Seeing as our application works with general tasks and bills and not specifics like supplies, we can reach a wider audience.
