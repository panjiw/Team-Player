                “Team Player” is an open source product, so all of our source code and releases will be facilitated through Github. Source code for the latest stable released version can be found from our github repository: 
                <a href="https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player/releases">https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player/releases</a>. 
                <br><br>
                Prior releases can be found on the same page. The latest version of our repository that we’re using for development can be found from here <a href="https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player.git">https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player.git</a>.

              	<h2 id="sec1">Getting started</h2>
              	<p>
                If you are unfamilar with Ruby on Rails, here is a <a href="#sec5">quick guide to the file structure</a>
                The following installation instructions assume you are using a Linux system.
              	</p>
                <p>
                <ol><li>First, setup rails environment for your OS<br>
                <code><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/">https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/</a></code></li>
                <br>
                <li>Install git, then navigate to folder you want to store our code and run<br>
                <code>git clone https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player.git</code></li>
                <br>
                <li>Navigate to the Team-Player folder and run<br>
                <code>bundle install -- without production</code></li>
                <br>
                <li>Note: For security reasons, secrets.yml and database.yml are not shown publicly on github<br>
                To create your own, navigate into the config folder<br>  -- rename the secrets-example.yml to secrets.yml
                    <br> -- rename database-example.yml to database.yml
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>To generate your secret_token, run <br>
                <code>rake secret</code><br>  -- copy the key, and open secret.yml<br>  -- replace the "run_rake_seret_and_copy_key_here" message
                with your copied key<br>     -- you will have to paste it in two places</li>
                <br>

                <li>To setup the database, run<br>
                <code>bundle exec rake db:migrate</code>
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>Finally, you can start the rails server by running<br>
                <code>rails s</code></li>
                <br>

                <li>If successful, you can see our application on<br>
                <code><a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a></code></li>
                <br>

                </ol>
                <p>Now you can start editing the codes and view the effects on the localhost website!</p>

              	<h2 id="sec2">Test Instruction</h2>
              	<p>
                The tests provided for the software are in the spec folder. At the moement, these tests cover our backend implementation, and utilize RSpec. 
                After you have downloaded our application, to run the test suite provided, go to the root directory of the project, run the command: <br> 
                <code>bundle exec rspec spec/</code><br><br>
                This will run all the tests and output the results. For more information about RSpec, go to: <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/frames">http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/frames</a>

                <li>Give us some information about the bug. It must be clear, such as "clicking on home takes me <i>this page</i> instead of <i>that page</i>," not "the home button doesn't work." List the steps we need to reporduce this bug. What did you do to reach this problem? What were you tryingto do?</li>
                </ol>

              	<h2 id="sec4">New Version Releases</h2>
      			
                Releases will be facilitated through GitHub’s release system. In-depth information on releasing software can be viewed at: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases">https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases</a>.<br><br> Updates and fixes, as well as branch information and version numbers will be documented with each release.<br><br>
                Releases for our software can be found and downloaded from: <a href="https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player/releases">https://github.com/panjiw/Team-Player/releases</a>.<br><br> New releases will be deployed through Heroku web services. 
                <p><ol>
                <li>Be sure to have the heroku toolbelt installed and set up with your account, <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com">https://toolbelt.heroku.com</a></li>
                <li>For the first deployment, the developer should run <br><code>heroku create</code></li>
                <li>Then, when a new release is completed and ready to be copied to the website and viewed and run through our test suite, a developer will deploy their repository with <br><code>git push heroku master</code></li></ol></p><br>

            <h2 id="sec5">File Structure</h2>
              <p>The directory structure uses the standard Ruby on Rails structure. From the root directory, listed below is information for the folders relevant to developers. Other folders contain information necessary for the product, such as bundle and rails files, but not necessary to edit for development. For further information on what those files contain go to: <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm</a> </p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>root folder</i>: contains gems and rake files for Ruby</li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>app</i>: contains the application code, our backend ruby code and front end views. The subfolders include: <i>assets</i>, <i>controllers</i>, <i>helpers</i>, <i>mailers</i>, and <i>models</i>. These contain code relevant to their subsections. For example, the model subfolder contains models for our user data, and the view folder contains the main front-end web files.</li>
              <li><i>config</i>: contains the environment and key configuration for the product. </li>
              <li><i>db</i>: contains the main backend data files in the database. </li>
              <li><i>devfiles</i>: Contains front end development code. This includes the Calendar front end code, style sheets, and html view pages.</li>
              <li><i>public</i>: contains public HTML documents, such as the 404 page.</li>
              <li><i>spec</i>: contains the testing information for backend and frontend development. Relevant tests for each section will be in its own subfolder. For example, controller RSpec tests are in the controller subfolder and front-end javascript tests are in the javascripts subfolder.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Documentation for the code can be found from the README in the main directory.</li>
          </ul>

            <h2 id="sec6">Publishing To Heroku</h2>

Our application will differentiate itself by providing a calendar view of events to facilitate time-dependant tasks. While HomeSlice provides a lot of services for roommates to organize their group, it does not provide a calendar view that could make the application difficult for paying bills on time or completing tasks on time. Furthermore, HomeSlice specifically targets roommates as a user base and not just groups who need to organize events. Seeing as our application works with general tasks and bills and not specifics like supplies, we can reach a wider audience.
