Their project tries to be a more flexible and contextual way to share thoughts between friends or like minded travellers, by using posting pins on a map. The product has competitors that provide similar functionality, but only allowing users to post about sites in their vicinity gives them definite value. The Facebook integration and login--allowing users to view pins from their friends--is a plus, and will mitigate the danger of spam. Their requirements are fairly clear and well written--they have decided on specific features with a clear timeline to finish them. </span></p><p style="widows:2;text-indent:36pt;orphans:2;color:#000000;direction:ltr;font-size:11pt;margin:0;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;padding:0"><span>From the paper prototype evaluation, we found a number of ways to improve the user interface. When logging into the applications, users were first confused as to the purpose of the product. The interface of the map was intuitive, but the purpose was not. One of the suggestions to solving this problem was to add an about page that would explain the purpose of this product. This would help users understand what the pins mean when they first use the application. Another idea to help with this problem was to add a question mark button to click and explain functionality.</span></p><p style="widows:2;text-indent:36pt;orphans:2;color:#000000;direction:ltr;font-size:11pt;margin:0;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;padding:0"><span>Users did not at first understand the purpose of locked and unlocked pins. This was made confusing by the interface because there was no way of distinguishing between the two. Users would be able to view how many pins they have unlocked, but have no confirmation what those pins were or where. This could be helped by color coding pins that were unlocked so users could visually see their pins, and adding a list of unlocked pins to their userpage. </span></p><p style="widows:2;orphans:2;color:#000000;direction:ltr;font-size:11pt;margin:0;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;padding:0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, once the functionality was understood, the application&rsquo;s simple map interface was very intuitive for users. Because using the Google Maps API would bring in similar functionality to different applications, users could easily navigate the application without much confusion. Additionally, the settings menu and posting menu were very clean and simple to understand. Users would not have much problems navigating the application once they understood the product. </span></p><p style="widows:2;orphans:2;color:#000000;direction:ltr;font-size:11pt;margin:0;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;padding:0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if there were too many pins on the board users could easily get overwhelmed by the product. For example, users could post a lot of pins in the same place and there would be little way of distinguishing them. Some functionality that would improve this would be the ability to filter out pins by friends and public. The development team suggested that there could be buttons on the map to show facebook only or public only. This would help with the problem of too many pins. Additionally, the development team informed us that the pins would expire after a month. This was not clear in their interface design but would help with possible complications. </span></p><p style="widows:2;orphans:2;color:#000000;direction:ltr;font-size:11pt;margin:0;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;padding:0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more complication was that users could not figure out how to log out of the product. A login screen would appear when first using the product, but there was no logout button on the settings. This could easily be fixed just by adding a logout button. However, overall, once the product purpose was understood it became much easier to use. The integration of a simple map API helped usability even if the product purpose wasn&rsquo;t intuitive at the beginning. </span></p><p style="widows:2;text-indent:36pt;orphans:2;height:11pt;color:#000000;direction:ltr;font-size:11pt;margin:0;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;;padding:0"><span></span></p></body></html>
