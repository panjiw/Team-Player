===========

	Team PLayer is a web application where users can create groups/circles of people to share bills and tasks with. 
	Each user can view:
	- their own tasks for a calendar month, as well as previous and future calendar months
	- all group memberâ€™s tasks by month
	- overview of bills pertaining to group
		- this means bills added to group may include or not include the user
			- bills can pertain to entire group or subset of groups
	- overview of bills pertaining to only the user
		- even if the bill was added by another member
	- amounts user owes another member
